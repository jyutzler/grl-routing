== Routing Extension (Normative)

=== Extension Title

Routing

=== Introduction

The US Army Geospatial Research Lab (GRL) has identified a need for the ability to store routing information in a GeoPackage. This capability will be used to support routing operations such as shortest path.


=== Extension Author

Geospatial Research Lab, author_name `grl`.

=== Extension Name or Template

`grl_routing`

=== Extension Type

New requirements not dependent on existing clauses.

=== Applicability

This extension applies to GeoPackages that are used to hold routing networks.

=== Scope

read-write

=== Requirements

==== Table Definitions
[[routing_columns]]
===== Routing Columns
[requirement] A GeoPackage that contains one or more routing networks SHALL contain a `grl_routing_columns` table or view as per <<grl_routing_columns_table>>.
Subsequent extensions or custom implementations MAY add additional columns to this table.
Clients SHALL ignore additional columns that are unrecognized.

.Routing Columns Table Definition
[cols=",,,,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Column Name |Column Type |Column Description |Null |Default |Key
|`id`|INTEGER	|Autoincrement primary key|no||PK
|`node_table`|TEXT|Name of table containing network nodes|no||
|`edge_table`|TEXT	|Name of table containing network edges|no||
|`edge_cost_column`|TEXT|Name of column in `edge_table` containing costs|yes||
|`edge_start_node_column`|TEXT|Name of column in `edge_table` containing IDs representing the starting node of the edge|no||
|`edge_end_node_column`|TEXT|Name of column in `edge_table` containing IDs representing the ending node of the edge|no||
|=======================================================================

===== Routing Results
[requirement] An application that uses a routing network to perform a routing analysis MAY return its results in a virtual view. If this occurs, the view SHALL have a schema as per <<grl_routing_results>>.

==== Table Values
===== `gpkg_contents`
:topology_scope: footnote:[The topological structure of the data is outside the scope of this document.]
[requirement] (extends http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_requirement-34[GPKG-34]) The http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#_contents[`gpkg_contents`] table SHALL contain a row with a `table_name` column value of `grl_routing_columns` and a `data_type` column value of `routing`.

===== `gpkg_extensions`
[requirement] GeoPackages complying with this extension SHALL have a row in the `gpkg_extensions` table as described in <<gpkg_extensions_records>>:

===== `grl_routing_columns`
The following requirements refer to the `grl_routing_columns` table as per <<grl_routing_columns_table>>.

[requirement] The table referenced by `node_table` SHALL have an `id` column of type 'INTEGER'.

[requirement] The table referenced by `edge_table` SHALL have an `id` column of type 'INTEGER'.

[requirement] If present, the column referenced by `edge_cost_column` SHALL be of type 'REAL'. If this column is not populated, each node SHALL have an equal weight.

[requirement] The columns referenced by `edge_start_node_column` and `edge_end_node_column` SHALL be of type 'INTEGER'. Records in these columns SHALL reference the `id` column of `node_table`.
